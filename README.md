# Web-Scraping-in-Python
## Introduction
This project is designed for film directors' works analysis. What we want to explore is the relationship between films' performance and film directors' background.

## Steps to follow
- Directors dataset: [Extract directors' birthplace/birthday/bio/trivia/race/gender information](https://github.com/MengyaoHuang/Web-Scraping-in-Python/blob/master/web%20scrapping.ipynb)
  - A short VBA code to automatically download images from url address and insert in Excel


## Introduction
- Data analysis is crucial to evaluating and designing solutions and applications, as well as understanding user's information needs and use. In many cases the data we need to access is distributed online among many webpages, stored in a database, or available in a large text file. Often these data (e.g. web server logs) are too large to obtain and/or process manually. 
- We need an automated way of gathering data, parsing it, and summarizing it before more advanced analysis.
- Topics would contain techniques of exploratory data analysis, using scripting, text parsing, structured query language, regular expressions, graphing, and clustering methods to explore data.
